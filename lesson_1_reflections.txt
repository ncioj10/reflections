How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only changed lines are being shown

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can have an easy overview over the chages i've made and that can help
     me finding bugs or typos.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    No uncompleted code will be updated and therefore there are no debug failures etc.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programmers often work with workspaces that contain relevant files for just one project. 
    Therefore a change in only one file would make the entire project unusable until 
    the other files are commited too.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log gives overview over the changes to a repo. git diff shows differences
   between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If a bug occurs even if it's much later you can still go back and see where it 
    came up and fix it. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Sync files online. Get version control and make handy edits.
